The script allows acquisitions using FLIR machine vision cameras
There are three modes of acquisition

1) trigger - This mode senses when there is a higher than background signal and starts an acquisition. All frames are accumulated and stopped when background is restored
2) time - This mode acquires for a user-set time saving each frame individually
3) continuous - This mode acquires and saves each frame individually until interupted by the user

with the exception of time mode, the programme will not stop running until a keyboard interupt (Ctrl+c) is triggered

For further description of the config parameters see the acompannying document

RUN:

python3 Basic_acquisition.py ./PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE ./PATH_TO_SAVE_OUTPUT
